#Transport Control Protocol
#built on top of IP(internet protocol)
# assumes IP might lose some data, so it stores and re transmits data if its lost
#handles flow control using a transmit window
#provides a nice pipe
#TCP connections = socket

#In computer networking, an internet socket or network socket is an
#endpoint of a bidirection inter-process communication flow across an internet
#protocol-based computer network, such as the Internet

#TCP port numbers
#a port is an application-specific or process-specific software communications
#endpoint
#it allows multiple networked applications to coexist on the same server
#there is a list of well known TCP port numbers
