# AC3-2023-Model

## Student Knowledge Assessment: Identification of Needed Knowledge, Goals, and Interim Deliverables

### Goal 
- This project aims to create a proof-of-concept software application that gives visibility to the geographic location and quantities of available food, water, and fuel.
- The AC3's project client is Black and Rossi
- Black and Rossi want to enhance the efficiency of the tools they already are using in order to provide more clarity to military operations overseas

### What is our team's S.W.O.T?
Our strengths:
- Diversity of majors, minors, and education experience. 
- Two subteams with a specific focus: Strategy & Problem Solving and Coding & Modeling
- Experience in geographical data collection
- Previous experience with consulting through the school's AC3 class.

Our weaknesses:
- Lack of exposure to this industry.
- Lack of real-world experience in this type of project

The opportunities this project brings to our team:
- Gaining experience in real-world problems and multinational problems.
- Networking.
- Gaining new skills and knowledge.

Threats this project brings to our team:
- Time constraints with the Russo-Ukrainian War.
- Research databases.
- Language barriers.

### External 
What resources and knowledge do we have already?
- Experience in programming languages and software, for example, Windows, R, and Python.
- Hypothesis testing, estimation, correlation, and regression and related problems
- Use statistical software to access data sources
- Researching reliable data sources and valid information

What departments and organizations are likely to have the resources and knowledge that we do not have and could need? 
- Math/CS, International studies, German, and communication departments could all have useful information

### Our Timeline
Week 1-4:
- Begin research into databases/information of where the supplies are located
- Look over old materials in order to gain an understanding of the progress old groups made
- Look into whether utilizing zip codes to pinpoint location and be able to provide information on nearby resources
- Find a good test location in order to see if our code works  (potential for Poland or German)
Week 5-8:
- Test databases against preconceived assumptions
- Developing an effective way to pull relevant data from the reliable data sources
Week 9-12:
- Use data to create a standardized format that is scalable for all other tools

### Our Team
- Joseph Dorsch: Coding/Modeling
- Chloe Tran: Coding/Modeling
- Owen Poling: Coding/Modeling
- Paige Irrer: Coding/Modeling & Data Collection/Strategy
- Lauren Hall: Data Collection/Strategy
- Aminaa Injinash: Data Collection/Strategy

### Agreed Upon Deliverables:
Due: November 15th, 2023
Goal: The final report will provide a demonstration of the tool, delivery of the source code, and a complete overview of the project.
- Proof of concept for Germany, Poland, and the UK
- The overview of the project will include the initial project plan, the work done, any problem encountered and solved, assumptions made, technical information on the tool, and user documentation on how to efficiently use the tool.
